        My name is Mallory and I was born and raised in Austin, Texas.  I majored <br> in Psychology at Sam Houston State University.  My favorite subject <br> is cognitive psychology with a focus on mental processes such as attention, <br> memory, creativity, and thinking.  It was in this class that I discovered <br> Human Factors Psychology, some of which examines human behavior in <br> order to find the best way to design products.  But it wasn't until I worked <br> at Indeed, recruiting for tech talent, that I realized I possessed a similar <br> passion for UX/UI.  </p>

            My guilty pleasure, after a hard day's work, is watching a show called <br> 90 Day Fiancé where long-distance relationships, halfway around the world, <br> have just 90 days to decide whether the courtship should conclude with marriage.
