            <p>My name is Mallory and I was born and raised in Austin, Texas.  I majored <br> in Psychology at Sam Houston State University.  My favorite subject <br> is cognitive psychology with a focus on mental processes such as attention, <br> memory, creativity, and thinking.  It was in this class that I discovered <br> Human Factors Psychology, some of which examines human behavior in <br> order to find the best way to design products.  But it wasn't until I worked <br> at Indeed, recruiting for tech talent, that I realized I possessed a similar <br> passion for UX/UI.</p>

            I fulfilled a lifelong dream and took an off-road adventure on an all-terrain <br> quad bike through the rugged landscape surrounding Reykjavík, Iceland.

            My guilty pleasure, after a hard day's work, is watching a show called <br> 90 Day Fiancé where long-distance relationships, halfway around the world, <br> have just 90 days to decide whether the courtship should conclude with marriage.
        </li> <br>
        <li>
            One of my bucket list items is to visit Tokyo, Japan and be dazzeled by their <br> traditional culture while experiencing their passion for everything new.
